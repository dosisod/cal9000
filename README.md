# cal9000

Vim enabled version of [cal(1)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cal).

## Why?

I want to get better about using calendars, but I don't like the thought of
using an online one. I also wanted something that I could use from the CLI
with ease, and be very effecient with it.

$ pip install cal9000
